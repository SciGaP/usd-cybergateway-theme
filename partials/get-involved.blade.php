        <p><strong>SciGaP</strong> is building a hosted Platform as a Service for Science Gateways. &nbsp;The hosted service will be based on <a href="http://airavata.apache.org">Apache Airavata</a> and the Workbench Framework. Initial usage of SciGaP services will be limited to the gateways supported by the project team members before we expand to support additional gateways. However, SciGaP services will always be based on freely available open source software available through the Apache Airavata project.</p>
